My journey to pursue a career in data began as I developed an interest in learning Python while I was in my living room in Wilmington, North Carolina. I started to develop applications that automatized task such as emails, sending SMS text, and web scrapers in effort to spend less time on mundane tasks. As I traveled to Bordeaux, France to pursue my master at Kedge Business School for Supply Chain Management, I discovered that Python programing can be used to manage, and manipulate data to solve everyday problems. This eventually became my passion as I have conducted multiple studies for companies like Sephora in effort to optimize their operations by means data utilization.
